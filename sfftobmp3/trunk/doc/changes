CHANGES
-------

V0.1 : crude start
V0.2 : code cleanup, added support for multiple pages, robust
       file handling.
V0.3 : added support for PBM output.
V1.0 : finally fixed mirroring bug (after recognizing that as
       a bug). Page orientation should be correct now.
V1.1 : changed license to BSD-style with advertising clause removed.
V1.2 : added -bmpx and -pbmx switches to add file extensions,
       changed mode of output file to binary (caused problems
       with MS Windows), fixed bug with bmp output (wrote one
       additional line).
V2.0 : added jpeg and tiff output, sfftobmp now honours the vertical
       resolution (lpi) field in the sff header and doubles
       the scanlines accordingly.
V2.1 : added single-page tiff output on request (sic!),
       added adjustable jpeg quality,
       omitted exception in the no-black-after-white-code case -
       this seems to be a common error therefore continuing decoding
       here seems reasonable. There maybe also an error in the code
       table but omitting the exception fixed the problem faster ;),
       changed the wording of the license for clarity.
V2.2 : contributions by Ulf Zibis (thanks a lot!):
       restructured and cleaned up code, preserve resolution information
       in output files (JPG/BMP and TIFF), made line-doubling optional,
       handle 300 and 400 dpi information (for SFF files created by
       RVS COM)
       *
       contribution by Gernot Hillier (thanks a lot, too!):
       output on stdout possible for multipage TIFF output
       *
       me:
       changed the wording of the license to include contributors
       created CREDITS file
       restructured the code even more
       added new commandline option parser my_getopt ((C) by Benjamin Sittler)
       adapted stdout patch for Windows
       tuned decoder to handle extended codes and EOLs
V3.0 : me:
       shuffled the code quite a bit
       changed commandline options, now includes multi-file processing
       made keeping the date possible for linux, too
       fixed decoder bug which did not decode a full line (Kudos to Eckhard Rueggeberg)
       fixed extended MH codes (wrong bitorder; silly me)
V3.1 : me:
       changed message output from stderr to stdout except errors (duh!)
       added -quiet switch
       some fixes from debian package
       some big endian fixes
       allowed up to 2048 bytes "fuzz" at the beginning of the file
V3.1.1 me:
       set the "DateTime" field within TIFF files with the UTC value of the 
       input file's mtime (suggestion by asterisk@puzzled.xs4all.nl).
V3.1.2 me:
       treat files with empty pages correctly (thanks to dirk.fellenberg@interdata.de).
V3.1.3 me:
       corrected path handling under Windows, no features added or changed.
       Sfftobmp -v now also prints the library versions involved.
       The source tree now also contains makefile and 3rd-party libs for
       compilation with Microsoft Visual C.
V3.1.4 me:
       fixed stdout output under Windows (crash), no features added or changed.
V3.1.5 me:
       fixed error introduced by new behaviour of boost::filesystem V3
       (appending sequential page numbers to output filenames gone missing)
