SFFVIEW 0.4
-----------

Tool to view "structured fax files" in X11.

SFF - Wotsit ?
-----------------
SFF means 'structured fax file' and is the file format that ISDN cards with 
CAPI interface expect and create.

If you don't have an ISDN card: just don't care ;).

Compilation
-----------

Windows:

* First compile wxWidgets using static runtime and static wx libs:
    cd \wx\build\msw:
      nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug UNICODE=1 SHARED=0 RUNTIME_LIBS=static
      nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release UNICODE=1 SHARED=0 RUNTIME_LIBS=static

* Then call
    cd win32
    nmake nodebug=1 /f makefile.vc all

Linux:

In most cases a call to 'make' may be sufficient.

You need:

wxGTK, version 2.9 or newer and all libraries that wxGTK needs itself.
